# Fizz-Buzz
ðŸ”¢ Educational Alexa Skill for playing Fizz Buzz

## Getting Started

These following instructions show how to open and run the Alexa Skill on the Alexa Developer Console (ADC):
```
2.) Open and login to your ADC account.
3.) Select "Create Skill" and choose the "Custom Model" and "Alexa-Hosted (Node.js)"
4.) Select "Import Skill" and copy-paste the URL for this repository.
5.) Navigate to the "Test" tab to play the game through the ADC or connect to your own device.
6.) To launch the game, simply tell Alexa "Hey Alexa, open fizz buzz game"
```
## How To Play
To play Fizz-Buzz, you and Alexa will start counting up from 1. The catch, however, is that all numbers divisible by 3 should be replaced by "fizz" and all numbers divisble by 5 should be replaced with "buzz." If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it should be replaced with "fizz buzz." 

To play again, simply ask Alexa to "play again" or "new game."

If you missed what she said, just ask "repeat" or "what did you say?"

See how high you can go!
